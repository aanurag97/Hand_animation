Code of synthetic shape generation by Anurag Shukla

Files:
1. ellipse.png
2. hand.png
3. mean_shape.csv
4. mean_shape_hand.csv
5. discrete_shape.py
6. simulation.py

Directions to use files:

1. Use discrete_shape.py to generate data from image file. Two image
files are given for test. Any other can be added. Related change in
code for image name should be done.
2. Output of discrete_shape.py is saved as CSV file which is used in
subsequent code.
3. simulation.py is used to generate shaped from above CSV file data.
Change values of beta from (-4 to 4) to see different shapes.

Note:

Two methods are used for split & merge. Code for both is present.
